Interesting article regarding piracy and pc gaming:  Recently there has been a lot of talk about how piracy affects PC gaming. And if you listen to game developers, it apparently is a foregone conclusion - if a high quality PC game doesn’t sell as many copies as it should, it must be because of piracy. Now, I don’t like piracy at all. It really bugs me when I see my game up on some torrent site just on the principle of the matter. And piracy certainly does cost sales.  But arguing that piracy is the primary factor in lower sales of well made games? I don’t think so. People who never buy software aren’t lost sales. Is it about business or glory: http://draginol.joeuser.com/article/303512/Piracy_PC_Gaming
