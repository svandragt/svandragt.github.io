To quickly access the files you’ve been working on today, create a new Favorites item for these files.

To do this, open Windows Explorer and select your Libraries link on the left. Then in the search box, enter modified:today and click the Save Search toolbar button.

Enter a name, such as Libraries Today, and press enter. You will now see the new item appear in your Favorites menu.

You can select this item whenever you need to access recently worked on files.
