I wish all Wordpress Plugins had their settings in ONE menu, and all entries in this Plugin Settings menu MUST be named identically to the plugin.

Not “broken links” plugin with settings -> permalinks -> “link checker” because I will never find it.

Time for a wordpress plugin settings corrector plugin
