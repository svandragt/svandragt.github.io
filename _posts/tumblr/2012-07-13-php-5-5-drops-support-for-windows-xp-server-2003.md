PHP 5.5 drops support for Windows XP / Server 2003
  PHP 5.5 will no longer support Windows XP and 2003. Those systems are around a decade old, so PHP is pulling the plug on them.


It was already mentioned on the PHP 5.4 release changelog. It makes sense, but Iâ€™m sure it will cause some issues with organisations who have not been paying attention. I would encourage all developers to sign up for the PHP Announcements mailinglist.
