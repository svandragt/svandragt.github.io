Interesting article by Tom Phillips interviewing developers about Windows 8 and it’s closed Windows Store, with this gem of a quote from Introversions’ Chris Delay:


> “I really don’t want to see the PC becoming a closed platform. Microsoft is not a company that’s able to benignly oversee that process. >They will f*** it up. We’ll all be doing Kinect support and 16 language versions, we’ll all be supporting a Microsoft Office plug-in. >It’s my own worst nightmare.
> 
> […] “The PC continues to be as relevant as it was ten years ago, despite consoles coming and going, because it is an open platform. If >that changed it would be terrible.”


It’s interesting times for the gaming industry, indeed.
