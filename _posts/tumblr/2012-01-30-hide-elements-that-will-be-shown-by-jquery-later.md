I stumbled upon this gem by Jerph on Stackoverflow:

Right after the body tag, put a script tag with this javascript:

jQuery(''body'').addClass(''js'');
This gives you a style hook for any elements that will look different in some way when Javascript enabled, and it happens immediately.

viaÂ css - Hide jQuery Accordion while loading - Stack Overflow.
