Bard uses move/copy operations to quickly organise your audio files into favourite folders. You can specify an ‘unlimited’ amount of folders which can all be used to sort audio to with one click. Other basic file operations such as renaming, deletion of audio is also supported.

In the resources folder you will find a small utility to create a basic audio library structure for you.
