PowerShell is a complete replacement for any of Microsoft’s DOS or Windows command line interpreters. It is a full fledged object oriented system administration scripting language. With PowerShell knowledge you would run circles around any sysadmin that works predominantly from through the GUI, as well as be able to get Windows to do things that you just can’t do through a GUI alone.http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/topics/msh/cmdlets/index.mspx
