re: Streamlining U.S. CurrencyMarco proposes to streamline the U.S. currency.


  By making my proposed eliminations, we’d have a much more streamlined system and no denominational jumps greater than 5x:
  
  1 cent: I don’t care whether we keep these. I’ll still keep them in a bowl and eventually bring them to a Coinstar machine for Amazon credit.
  5 cents (5x previous denomination)
  25 cents (5x)
  $1 (4x): I don’t care whether it’s a coin or a bill. Just pick one.
  $5 (5x)
  $20 (4x)
  $100 (5x)
  Much simpler.


It sounds very much like the Euro coins and banknotes policy, so why not go for the same denominations as they do? This will benefit tourism and local trade but keep all benefits of Marco’s system.

I’m much in favour of getting rid of anything under 5 cents, it just makes it harder to carry a wallet with no benefit to the consumer.
