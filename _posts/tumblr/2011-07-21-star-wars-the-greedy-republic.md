Buying the game today for  £50-£65 from Origin will not only give you a holographic dancer (!) and allow you to change the color of your lightsaber (!), but also get you early access, before everyone else! How early is this access that you pay a £30 premium for?
Precise dates will be revealed at a later time.
Via Preorder FAQs | Star Wars: The Old Republic. It’s time to find another hobby.
