This is great for the following reason:
It will help supporting Firefox because there will just be two versions that matter: the up to date version, and the old version (which is any older version).
This simplifies any solution and troubleshooting, it either works in the current version, or Firefox will update - if it’s connected to the internet. Which means eventually, Firefox is always up to date and there will no old versions and therefore no issues.
