As a hobbyist music producer, I have a lot of samples of sounds. As I have decided to start organising these, I needed a quick way to fire off samples in wav and mp3 format through Windows Explorer.

So I created InstaPlay. This is a simple sound player. To install it simply unzip it in a directory that’s in the path, and then associate wav and mp3 files (and whatever else you want to use) with it.  It also has a few features:
Just double click or run a soundfile to hear it play.
	Nice speaker icon in system tray while a sound is playing. Double click it to quit InstaPlay and stop playback.
	Run  another sound file to switch playback to that instead.

This program will help you categorize more efficiently as you can move the sound that’s being played without pesky ‘file in use’ prompts.
