Blog comments - on or off?
  For most people, a comment form is an essential part of what a blog is, and most of us enjoy the opportunity to leave feedback (even if we do so only rarely). But there are also plenty of possible reasons why comments are unnecessary, or undesirable.


You might have heard about the Comments On/Off discussion that has been going round the blogosphere. This article by Matt Gemmell is a good starting point, then listen to Build and Analyze 59: Premium Products for more rationale.

The main argument for turning off blog comments is to encourage readers to direct comments to their own website, and link or notify the author of the original article. This will result in better quality comments and more responsibility for whatâ€™s written.
