 Just been reading Gizmo’s article on disabling Google’s text advertisements. I’m realizing it has come this far: people have been increasingly annoyed by advertising on their favourite websites. N now even Google’s textads are targeted because a small percentage puts the ads on the page people have become annoyed. So they disable the ads. That’s their right.   However that leaves millions of bloggers without a possible revenue stream to support their writing so I am thinking what it can be replaced with. I’ve no idea. Personally I wouldn’t donate to a website because I liked a certain article, donationware works best for ‘tools’. I don’t think I can get paid for putting legitimate search results underneath a post, which would be a benefit to readers, which is a shame. Subscription services go against the nature of the web (hiding content from public). I wouldn’t buy a mug just because i read a website. Maybe that means that it’s just too hard for an individual to recoup their costs?   That said, the majority of people will not have Adsense blocked. And I think the majority of bloggers don’t blog for money, but because they like to discuss.  Credit: Photo by mwagner01
