Aligning product and profit strategiesBenedict Evans writes:


  Android fragmentation is a serious problem for developers, since they face a massively fragmented user base, though it is rather less of a problem for Google, since a forked fragmented screwed-up Android phone still has a web browser and a data package and so is still generating Adsense eyeballs.
  
  Indeed, a helpful way to think about this is that Apple makes money from great apps by selling the hardware to run them, while Google loses money from great apps, since they lead to less web search.


This made me think about what success means. Both these companies are building popular mobile platforms with app stores. From the perspective that great apps in general provide a better experience than good web services, and taking into account that the consumer likes a smartphone / tablet with a good user experience better, can we can conclude that success for Apple is aligned with the interests of the user, while for Google it is opposed to the interests of he user?

If this is the case then eventually as the smartphones and tablets are developed along the path of profit, Apple will have to keep refining the apps on its platform, whilst in addition Google will also have to improve integration the web into it’s OS, in order to create a better experience for its users.

Android’s focus away from apps would seem to be a problem for hardware manufacturers, who are also depending on making money by selling hardware to run apps on. Perhaps this explains why HTC isn’t so hot these days.
