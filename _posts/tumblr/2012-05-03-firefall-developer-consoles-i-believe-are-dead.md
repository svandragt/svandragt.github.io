Firefall developer: "Consoles, I believe, are dead"Interesting article by Fred Dutton, speaking to former World of Warcraft lead Mark Kern:


  […] the Red 5 Studios CEO argued that the free-to-play model offers developers much more room to flex their creative muscles, rewarding gamers with more innovative gameplay experiences than risk-averse AAA console publishers can hope to offer.
  “The failure is that there’s no middle ground. All the games in the middle that could have been made but have been squeezed out and we’ve seen all these independent studios get closed down over the last few years.


The net driving force is distribution, and it’s disrupting all distribution channels.
