Instacast''s new pricing modelInstacast 2.0 is out, is cheaper than ever - with PRO “upgrade” (in-app purchase):


  Second, I added an in-app purchase for features that novice users won’t need most likely, but power-users will appreciate when using the app on a day-to-day basis. It’s called Instacast Pro and it’s for sale at $1.99.


I did need to buy Instacast Pro because the Downloaded smart playlist is now ordered new to old, and I want to listen to my podcasts in chronological order.

That’s fine however because I use Instacast every workday of the week, on my journey to and from work. It’s a great program and worth every penny.
