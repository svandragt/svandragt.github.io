Iâ€™ve released the following data extensions (might pack them up as modules):

HiddenFields DataExtension: Takes form fields specified through $hidden_fields and hides them from edit form.

Description DataExtension: Specify a $db_descriptions array to DataObjects to attach formfield descriptions.

update: They are now modules, see my github page.
