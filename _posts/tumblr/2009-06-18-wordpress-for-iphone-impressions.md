I’m currently testing the Wordpress iPhone app (WfI). It’s great for a free app! However I noticed a few things that need to be polished:
It didn’t retrieve the blogs categories from my blog and the category I added to this post wasn’t saved.
	The interface is a bit slow on the frontpage when clicking an option it doesn’t turn blue immediately
	There’s currently (18th June 2009) no way to edit the blog’s details after setting up, or ability to remove it that I have found. I changed my user’s password but I cannot change it in WfI! An Edit button on the blog selection screen would definately help in this case. I’ll have to remove the application and redownload it - maybe that helps.

Still it’s a great way to do some writing while not at a desktop and I appreciate the offline mode for iPod Touch users.
