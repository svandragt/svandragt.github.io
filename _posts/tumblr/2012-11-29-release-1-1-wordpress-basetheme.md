The aim for wordpress-basetheme is  a bare bones, well structured, easily customisable WordPress base theme.

- DRY ([don’t repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself))
- KISS ([keep it simple stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle))
- Easily customisable WordPress base theme.
- Uses [post formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats) (standard and link have been implemented)

You can build on it to speed up your own theme development. It’s so minimal that I wouldn’t recommend it as your final site theme. Instead it makes it trivial to apply your design to a WordPress blog, or to build out from this starting point. This site is build on top of the project for example.

Version 1.1 is now available: [Download](https://github.com/svandragt/wordpress-basetheme/archive/1.1.zip) | [View on GitHub](https://github.com/svandragt/wordpress-basetheme)

Your feedback is welcome.
