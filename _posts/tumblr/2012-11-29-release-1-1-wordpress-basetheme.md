Release 1.1 – wordpress-basethemeThe aim for wordpress-basetheme is  a bare bones, well structured, easily customisable WordPress base theme.

DRY (don’t repeat yourself)
KISS (keep it simple stupid)
Easily customisable WordPress base theme.
Uses post formats (standard and link have been implemented)
You can build on it to speed up your own theme development. It’s so minimal that I wouldn’t recommend it as your final site theme. Instead it makes it trivial to apply your design to a WordPress blog, or to build out from this starting point. This site is build on top of the project for example.
