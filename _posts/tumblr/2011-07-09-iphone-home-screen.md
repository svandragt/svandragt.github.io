It’s always fun to discover new apps, and a good way to see which apps are used most is to look at the first home screen. So here’s mine, where is yours?

The apps you can see are (apart from the built in Apple ones):
Captio - Send yourself a quick note with just one tap.
	Simplenote - An easy way  to keep notes, lists, ideas, and more.
	Action Lists - Getting Things Done made easy.
	moneyStrands - Personal finance software.
	UK & ROI - navFree navigation software.
	ShoppingList - The shopping tool for your iPhone or iPod touch.
	Dropbox - Bring your photos, docs, and videos anywhere and share them easily.
	Due - The missing reminder app fit for your homescreen (multiple alarms)
	Instacast - Instant access to podcast subscriptions, stream or download episodes wirelessly, follow show notes and enjoy audio and video podcasts on-the-go.
	Tiny Tower - Tower people management game
