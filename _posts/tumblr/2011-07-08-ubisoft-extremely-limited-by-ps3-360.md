We think that the next generation of consoles won’t have these limits any more. Games might have more realistic graphics and more on-screen, but what’s the value of making something more realistic and better animated if you have poor AI?

They might think they want better AI, but once the Xbox 4 and PS4 are out they will be back competing on graphics and violence.
