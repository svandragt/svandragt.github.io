No-cost desktop software development is dead on Windows 8
  Microsoft wants Windows developers to write Windows 8-specific, Metro-style, touch-friendly applications, and to make sure that they crank these apps out, the company has decided that Visual Studio 11 Express, the free-to-use version of its integrated development environment, can produce nothing else.


I do not think this is a big problem, any serious developer writing a windows desktop app will have no problem paying for Visual Studio.
If the philosophy is that the future is metro, people starting out now should write for metro.

If that is the case then, why not split it into Windows Metro and remove the whole desktop part of it, with Windows 8 Enterprise that has desktop only.
