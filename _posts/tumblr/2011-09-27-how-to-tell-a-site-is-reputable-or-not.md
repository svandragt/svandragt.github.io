I get asked every now and then if a new online shopping site is reputable or not. As there is no magic way to determine this I have written up these pointers to help you do the same.  Now please I am not responsible for any mistakes in ordering from a site that seems legit and then turns out to be fraudulent!

I’m trying to look at the following things:

* Do a google search for the domain name together with one of the following words added: reliable, reputable, fraud, scam etc. This might bring up a few experiences, check some links to determine that these experiences are geniune (not written by a competitor for example).
* Search for the domain name on the Web Of Trust. Don’t just look at the figures, look at the comments, so these seem geniune (have they been written with due care and attention and proper punctuation etc)?
* View the incoming links for the domain, using Alexa. Are these from geniune sites or things like link directories where people can add their sites just to get higher in the search results.
* If you know of a community that discusses the subject matter, search there too. They will probably have determined whether or not the site can be trusted.
* How active is their social media presence? See if they have a community of customers.
* Do a whois lookup for the domain to find out if it's a company or individual behind them and run a search for them as well. This usually brings back any sister websites that are owned by the same entity.
* Test the checkout process - Make sure it secure (https),  the certificate is assigned to the company that's behind the website, you can pay with Paypal, Google Accounts or another third party so that your credit card information isn't stored with the website itself.
 
I'll update the post with any other simple checks I come across. What do you do?
