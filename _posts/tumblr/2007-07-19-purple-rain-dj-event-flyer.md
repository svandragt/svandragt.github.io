As you can see below I created a flyer/poster for an event in Second Life. For those who don’t know, Second life is a virtual world created entirely by its users. Anyone can create an account and log on to build things, meet people for a chat, or dance in a club for example. Or fight in a Star Wars battle as a wookie. Or watch a movie in a cinema. Yep if you can think of it, you can probably do it.

Anyway, on friday night between 1-3pm PDT (Pacific Daylight Time) I have a DJ set in a nightclub called Purple Rain. I play some trip-hop, electro to a small crowd for a few hours. The club has decided to organize a DJ Talent contest and asked me to create a promotional poster. As there was a lot of information to put on and no photos so I decided to play around with positioning, grouping and lighting of text. The result is below. I think it turned out well.



How do you promote your SL event?

Update: I do not play at Purple Rain anymore. Find me “Cloudseer Writer” online in Second Life.
