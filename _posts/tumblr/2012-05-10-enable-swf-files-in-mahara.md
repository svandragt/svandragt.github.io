By default the Embedded Media Block allows you to embed FLV and MP3 files into your pages. However Mahara 1.5 also supports the following files:

AVI Video File
MP4 Video File
MPEG Movie
Quicktime Movie
SWF Flash movie
WMV Video File
Site administrators can enable these formats by going into Site Administration > Plugin Administration_ (under Administrator Extensions) > file/internalmedia (under Plugin type: blocktype) > Config. Then simply tick the file types you want to enable for users.
