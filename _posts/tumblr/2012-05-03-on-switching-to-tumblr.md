Today I switched this site to Tumblr. Overall, I’m very happy.

I imported the WordPress data using Wp2Tumblr which worked well for the most part. There were a couple of issues with unicode characters in post titles. However after removing these all posts imported without a hitch.
Thanks to Quora for pointing me to JotForm which is an excellent form builder that is now powering my contact page.
Finally, I’m hosting the CSS via a simple public Dropbox link, which allows me to make changes without logging into the dashboard.
In the near future I will be reblogging my posts from other sources so that all content will appear in one place.
