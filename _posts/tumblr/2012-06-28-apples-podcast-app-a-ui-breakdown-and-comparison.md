Apple''s Podcast app - a UI breakdown and comparisonChris Armstrong discusses Apple’s Podcast app:


  My favourite minor UI detail of Podcasts is the tape within the tape deck. If you look closely, the tape is actually being transferred from one reel to the next. Amazing.


Not sure how it works in practice yet as I am a happy Instacast user. That said I like the metaphor of a tape deck because the concept of a podcast can be abstract for someone who hasn’t heard of them before. Seeing them as a recording that gets delivered to your tape deck makes it easy to understand.

That said from the screenshots the layout looks a bit chaotic, with controls not aligned very well. For example, the vertical alignment of the speed knob feels off for me on the iPad as well as the navigation bar with the buttons that come after it, and on the iPhone screenshot none of the controls are left aligned. I think the app would benefit from more visual balance.

Maybe there are good reasons for these choices that I am not aware of? (for example the volume slider is moved more to the right to avoid people mistapping the ‘next’ button and inadvertently lowering the volume. But why not move it to the left of the navigation controls?)
