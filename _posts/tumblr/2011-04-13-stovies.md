YouTube - Stovies.

If the brilliant actor Dustin Hoffman had been born Scottish things may have been a bit different.
The most hilarious video I have seen in ages. Props to steve2007.

Note: Unfortunately, even though the american Supreme Court categorizes ’parody’ under Fair Use, YouTube doesn’t recognise that. I’ll keep this post up in the hopes that this excellent video returns. Source
