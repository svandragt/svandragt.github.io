Acquiring feedback on web projects can be harder than you’d think, especially when you’re working on internal projects that don’t get discussed on outside your organization. By making feedback a fun, easy and rewarding thing to do more people might be encouraged to help us and put in the effort.

I’m sure some of you are in a similar situation: you launch a project and silence follows. Trivial problems might emerge but a there’s no general response to the long hours you put in. That makes it much harder to evaluate the project and set a schedule for future developments.

To help with this we’ve created a UserVoice page. Let’s describe it as a digg-like FAQ. People are encouraged to leave a message, can vote on feedback they find important, and always have the full picture of what the development is focused on. Developers act on the consensus and theoretically will work on solving the most urgent issues.

Of course this model will work best when both users and developers care enough to communicate. So Uservoice is engineered to make it trivial to leave a message. It can be easily integrated into an existing site. Some functionality requires a user account, which is a stumbling block. But you can leave feedback without it, which is a bonus. Oh and it doesn’t integrate with any bug trackers which is a shame.

Will it work and will there be enough participation? Ask me again in 6 months time. I’m not sure how to make it any easier though.
