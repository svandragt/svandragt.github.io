PutAside 1.12 is outPutAside has been updated to 1.12. Itâ€™s a small tool to put aside what you are working on to complete an important  task. (Some people use it for presentations to switch between presentations and other programs).

This update includes the latest DCUpdater update checking utility and will no longer be flagged as a false positive by anti virus scanners. Oh, and the source is on GitHub.

Thanks to Ath for their reports.
